      "Built for ISBA 2438 Assignment 1, this project is a command-line inventory manager written in Python 3 using only the standard library. It stores products in a JSON file and supports full CRUD operations from the terminal.",
      "Every input is strictly validated before it touches the data file, and all writes are atomic, so the inventory file is never left in a half-written state. The CLI communicates results through exit codes: 0 for success, 1 for handled errors such as validation failures, and 2 for unexpected errors.",
      "Beyond CRUD, the tool includes a low-stock reorder report that surfaces products needing restocking. The project is covered by 27 end-to-end tests that exercise the CLI the same way a user would.",
